# Team Connect

Team Connect is a collaborative project that allows team members to interact and get to know each other using GitHub's collaborative features. This project encourages everyone to introduce themselves, share a little about their background, and even include their photos.

## Features
- Team members can add their personal details and a short bio.
- Git-based collaboration where everyone can contribute updates.
- A central hub to view all team members' introductions in a structured and interactive format.
